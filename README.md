Pretty Bird for Thunderbird 17
==========

![Thunderbird 17 userchrome](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/A_S_RhBCYAAiyri.png:medium)

Userchrome.css for Thunderbird 17 to make it yummy and pretty. 

**Few Notes**
- Only tested with Thunderbird 17 on Linux
- You'll need to adjust your toolbar buttons to not suck out of the gate
- It only addresses the main mailbox screen and not other things like Lightening, Add-ons and other sections.

**Installation**
- Add the userChrome.css to your Thunderbird directory ~/.thunderbird/[uid].default/chrome/
- - If the chrome folder doesn't exist, create it! 
- - Restart Thunderbird
