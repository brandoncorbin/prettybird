Pretty Bird for Thunderbird 17
==========

Userchrome.css for Thunderbird 17 to make it yummy and pretty. 

**Few Notes**
- Only tested with Thunderbird 17 on Linux
- You'll need to adjust your toolbar buttons to not suck out of the gate
- It only addresses the main mailbox screen and not other things like Lightening, Add-ons and other sections.
